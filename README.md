# study_on_GAN
The project is about study on generative adveserial neural networks. GAN's are in great use today in open AI applications like DALL-E and Midjourney. The repository contains building a simple GAN using keras and then applying it on inbuilt fashion_mnsit dataset. Later it also contains a notebook wherein GAN are used to map satellite images
